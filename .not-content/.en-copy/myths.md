      question: "Rapid Tests: Essential or Useless?"
      answer: >-
        It has become well-known that COVID-19 caused by the novel coronavirus
        (SARS-CoV-2) has turned into a pandemic affecting the whole world. This
        has made all countries to face a critical situation has never seen
        before. As it happened regarding many “hot topics”, unreliable content
        has spread through the internet quickly – including posts about denying
        the real danger or increasing the panic, fake news, quotes and facts
        taken out of their original context to give then an entirely different
        meaning.


        A special category of these sorts of unreliable information consists of articles trying to prove that tests – especially rapid assays – are useless and cause more harm than good. This page, which appeared on one of the most reliable Hungarian news portals has been read and shared by a lot of people. It is no doubt that the author’s original intent was benevolent – however, the article contained some inaccurate and unproven information. Although it has not been the only page that has been issued somewhat misleading content, we think it is worth reacting on the particular article. Hvg.hu is generally considered to be a relevant source of news; the fact they posted an article of certain pieces of inaccurate information shows how easy it is for other, less known pages to make the same mistake, too.

      question: Tests for the Masses
      answer: >-
        Firstly, how does the test go?


        One possibility is to detect the **genetic material** (the RNA) of the virus. The specimen can be collected using several types of human cells (e.g. the saliva). The RNA of the virus has to be isolated, and a detectable amount of genetic material can be produced by a reaction called PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction). This is a **highly reliable method for examining whether the virus is present in the body**.


        Rapid tests, on the other hand, detect the virus in an indirect way. These examine whether the **antibodies produced by the human immune system to the novel coronavirus** are present. These are called immunochromatography tests or serological tests, too; the rapid test name refers to the fact that the **result can be received in about 15 minutes**.
