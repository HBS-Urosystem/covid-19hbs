      question: Can it be detected if someone has been infected with the novel coronavirus?
      answer: >-
        **Yes. There are two different methods.**


        * From several different types of human cells, the genetic matter (RNA) of the virus can be detected. This method is called PCR test (Polymerase Chain Reaction test). Obviously, it is impossible to spot the genetic matter of one single virus, but it is possible to detect multiple copies of it – the chain reaction is performed for producing the necessary amount of genetic matter.

        * It is possible to detect the antibodies produced by the human body to the novel coronavirus. This method is called serological test, immunochromatography test, or rapid test – where the name refers to the fact that the assay can be done in 15 minutes.

      question: How does a rapid test work?
      answer: >-
        **The immune system is responsible for distinguish the “intruders” from the own cells and materials of the body. These “intruders” – also called antigens – can be several things, including bacteria and viruses.**


        When an antigen enters the body, the immune system starts producing multiple kinds of materials which are capable to fight off the bacteria and viruses (and the disease caused by them). These materials are called antibodies. This is happening in case of the novel coronavirus, too. There are antibodies which appear in the body only if the immune system meets a particular pathogen. The rapid tests thus detect the presence the antibodies which are produced only if the novel coronavirus is present in the body.
