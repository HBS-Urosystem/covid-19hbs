        ### Clungene® COVID-19 Antigen Rapid Test


        It detects the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 (which is detected by the human immune system, too). This test is for detecting the early phase of the infection.


        <small>Sensitivity: 91.4%. Specificity: 100.0%.</small>

        ### Clungene® COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test


        It detects the antibodies produced by the human immune system against the SARS-CoV-2 virus (IgG and (IgM). This test is for detecting the late phase of the infection, just as well as an infection happened in the past.


        <small>Sensitivity: 86.6%. Specificity: 98.33% (IgG+IgM combined). 8 days after the appearance of the symptoms, sensitivity is over 90%.</small>

    To slow the pandemic down and to minimize the economic loss caused by the
    COVID-19, **it is essential to test people regularly and in a systematic
    way.** Our company, **HBS Urológia Zrt. has been distributing both antibody
    and antigen rapid test cassettes**. Both of them can be performed quickly
    and can be applied by healthcare professionals at point of care (POC) sites.


    **Antigen tests** are capable of identifying COVID-19 at the **early phase** of the infection, whereas **antibody tests** can detect it in the **late phase and past infections**, too. In this way, the two tests **complement each other perfectly**.
  highlight: COVID-19 caused by the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) became a
    pandemic in the first half of 2020. In the fall the second wave broke up,
    causing an even more desperate situation in many countries.

      text: HBS Zrt. has obtained
        **[Bisnode&nbsp;A](https://www.bisnode.hu/ceginformacio/5291630/hbs-urologia-zrt/)**
        certificate. This testifies that the financial risk of co-operating with
        our company is low. Only the 7.44% of the Hungarian companies have
        obtained this certificate.
  text: Our company, **[HBS Zrt.](https://hbs.hu)**, is one of the major importers
    of rapid tests. Our supplier, [Hangzhou Clongene Biotech Co.
    Ltd.](http://en.clongene.com/) has been manufacturing more than 1,000 types
    of microbiological test materials and products. We have sold hundreds of
    thousands of tests in Hungary, supplied state institutions, healthcare
    institutions, municipalities and companies, too.

      ##### The following figure shows in what time period the antigen test and
      the antibody test is able to detect COVID-19. 


      <figure>

      <figcaption>

      <details><summary><b>Explanation of figure</b></summary>

      <p>This figure serves as a reference; it shows when the COVID-19 antigen (Ag) and the two immunoglobulins (IgM and IgG) can be detected. “0” represents the day when the symptoms first occur (onset day).</p>


      <p>The virus protein – the antigen – appears first; this can be detected by the antigen test. This is followed by the two antibodies, IgM and IgG, which are detected by the antibody test. The presence of IgM usually refers to the early-to-mid phase of the infection. In most cases, IgG appears later, in the second half of the infection, but it is present in the body in a detectable amount for months.</p>


      <p>The typical symptoms of COVID-19 appear 2–14 days after becoming infected; typically, 5–6 days after. In the period of incubation (shown by negative numbers) no test can detect the infection consistently. However, it is assumed that during the major part of this period people might not spread the infection because there is not enough virus in their body yet.</p>

      screening the employees of a company, an office or any other institution.
      Identifying and isolating those who are affected is an effective way of
      slowing the spread of the virus down, which may prevent the shut-down of
      the workplace and the financial loss associated with that."
