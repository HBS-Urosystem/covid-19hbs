      The substances recognized by the immune system and trigger the immune
      response are generally called antigens. An antigen test detects **directly
      of the presence of SARS-CoV-2**. This aspect is common with the PCR test.
      However, antigen tests detect **a specific protein of the virus**, not the
      RNA of it.


      It must be pointed out that the virus antigen is present in a detectable amount **in the early phase of the infection** – antigen tests are thus the most reliable when they are used in the **first 7 days after the onset day** (when the symptoms first appear).
    title: What is detected by an antigen rapid test?
  - text: >-
      * It is considerably cheaper than a PCR test

      * Medical professionals can perform it at point-of-care (POC) sites, too, e.g. in a suitable room of a company

      * No additional devices or disposables are needed for the test

      * The results are obtained within 15–30 minutes


      Although they are slightly less sensitive than PCR tests, they **can be used together with antibody tests**, since **they detect COVID-19 in the phase of the infection when antibody tests are not able to do so yet.**
    title: What are the advantages of an antigen rapid test?
  - text: >-
      Assuming all the employees (or clients) are being screened systematically
      with antibody rapid tests at an institution, antigen tests mean the **next
      step of testing** in any case when performing a PCR test is not possible
      (e.g. lack of time or financial resources).


      If a person has been tested positive with an antibody test, the antigen test **can be strengthen the diagnosis of an active infection**. In case of a confirmed new infection, with antigen tests **close contact can be tested** to discover whether they have got COVID-19, too in a cost-effective way. (Antibody tests often miss the early phase of the infection.)


      Moreover, with an antigen test COVID-19 can be detected even if the antibody test has been negative but the person **shows the** (mild) **symptoms of the disease or have met confirmed COVID-19 people recently**.


      Finally, having an antigen test made **is the best way of detection if it is crucial to get the result as quickly as possible – when there is no time for a PCR test**. For example, for employees having to start a business trip or at medical institution for patients whose treatment cannot be delayed.


      An antigen test is **not recommended** if the symptoms have been persisting for a long time, and they cannot detect past infections. In these cases, an antibody test is to be performed.

      Nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swab has to be collected as specimen.
      Next, there are a couple of easy steps needed to be performed to prepare
      the specimen, which is placed on the test cassette. The result can be
      obtained in 15–30 minutes.


      The test can be performed by a healthcare professional at any place, no additional devices or disposables are needed for that.

    subtitle: There are two possible outcomes.
    text: >-
      #### 1. Only the control line appears on the cassette – negative result.


      In this case the tested person is most likely not infected, the virus is not present in their body. However, a negative result cannot role out the infection totally, because


      * it is possible that the viral protein is present in their system but its amount is so small that the antigen test cannot detect it;


      * if the specimen collection or the text is performed incorrectly, there may be no viral protein in the sample.


      #### 2. Both the control line and the test line appear on the cassette – positive result.


      Since the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein detected by the test is unique to this virus, the positive result means that the tested person is almost surely infected.


      Infected people **must be isolated** even if they have no symptoms at all, because **they can infect others with the virus, too**.

      The information the antigen rapid test provides is for reference whether
      people are infected or not. Applying an antigen rapid test cannot be the
      sole base of diagnosing or excluding COVID-19. In case the findings of the
      contact tracing or the current symptoms refer to an infection, the result
      of the antigen rapid test has to be confirmed with other diagnostic
      methods, e.g. a molecular assay.


      This test is for professional use only. A short summary on the (Hungarian) legal background of diagnostic tests can be found [here](https://covid-19.hbs.hu/legal-background).
