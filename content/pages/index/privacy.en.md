b) is enabled by any European Union or local law applied for the data controller that also states measurements for protecting the rights, freedom or legitimate interest of the person concerned;

c) is based on the expressed consent of the person concerned.

The data controller is obligated to take appropriate measurements to protect the rights, freedom or legitimate interest of the person concerned, minimally including the right to request for human intervention, express their standing-point, and submit an objection against the decision. 

## 11. Data Breach

In case of any breach that likely means high risk regarding the natural persons’ rights or freedom, the Data Controller informs the person concerned without undue delay.

Informing the person concerned shall happen in an unambiguous and articulate form, containing as follows: 

a) the nature of the breach

b) the probable consequences of the breach

c) the actions planned or performed to handle the breach, including the actions which are to lessen the possible negative consequences

d) provides the contact of the data protection officer, or if he/she is not available at that time, of a person who is able to give ample amount of information about the situation.

The Data Controller need not inform the persons who are involved in case of any of the following:

a) the data controller performed appropriate technical or organizational actions of defense; these actions have been performed for the benefit of the person concerned who is affected by the breach – especially measurements which have made the data affected by the breach incomprehensible for the unauthorized (eg. by using encryption on the data);

b) the data controller performed actions after the breach to ensure that the rights and freedom of the person concerned are most likely not in risk of danger anymore; 

c) informing the persons concerned would require measurements of disproportional effort. In this case the persons concerned shall be informed with the help of published information or in any other form of similar efficiency. 

In case the data controller has not informed the person concerned about the breach yet, the supervising authority may order to inform the person concerned if according the estimation of the authority the risk of the breach is likely high.

## 12. The Right to Legal Remedy

If the person concerned suspects that the law of data protection has been broken, they have the right to register a complaint, especially at the member state of their regular residence, workplace, or at the state where the suspected infringement has happened.

The supervisory authority the complaint has been submitted to is obligated to inform the person concerned on the result of their complaint, just as well as on the fact that he/she has the right to request legal remedy.

12.1. The right to request an effective judicial legal remedy against the supervisory authority

Every person concerned has the right to request an effective legal remedy to challenge a legally enforcing decision of the supervisory authority that affects them. If the supervisory authority does not handle the complaint or fails to inform the person concerned within 3 months about the result of the submitted complaint, the person concerned has the right to request for a legal remedy.

Any changes or amendments of the Privacy Policy shall be published on the Webpage. Regarding the controlling of personal data, the Privacy Policy in force shall be applied, regardless of the fact that at the time when the person concerned registered or provided personal data in any other way there might have been an earlier Privacy Policy in force.
